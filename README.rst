==========
Box List Checker for Write-On Stationery
==========

This program will cross refernce hand made box lists with the box lists in the data base from the Write-On website.

## How to use
1. Open your terminal and navigate to a folder that contains the box lists
2. download the box lists that you want to check from the honeycomb website (these are from the system and should be 100% correct)
3. (optional) You will likeley want to rename the downloaded box list from the system, as it will get confusing fast if checking multiple lists
4. Run the program WHILE IN THE DIRECTORY WITH ALL THE LISTS
5. Type the names of the lists into the program when prompted
6. When the program prompts you for input, read carefully and give the correct input. This will likely be mostly spelling mistakes.
7. Once all mistakes are corrected via input, all student matches will be outputted, followed by any errors that may be fixed
8. Manually fix errors (automatic eror fixing coming soon)
